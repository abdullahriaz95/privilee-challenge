# Privilee Challenge - Abdullah Riaz
##### Important Features
âœ… **State Management** - **Riverpod** state management is being used for in this project. I've also worked with BLoC, Provider, MobX, GetX, GetIt (Dependency Injection), Rx, etc.
âœ…  **Localization** - The project also entertains the Localization feature. Right now, the localization is only being done in English language. However, the setup is complete, and we can easily support multiple languages now.
âœ…  **Well Structured** -  Code is well structured. Every file is where it sould be. Logic, Data and UI is seperated. Code is well documented. Any Flutter developer would be able to easily understand what is going on in the project.
âœ… **Completeless** -  All the requirements given in the challenge are completed. Functionality is working fine.
âœ… **Extras** -  Banner contains the list of indicator dots, letting the user know where he stands. If he has more banners to see or not.

**Note** - I've kept everything simple and clean. I've also minimised the use of external packages which creates a dependency on those packages.

##### Future Improvements
There are a number of things we can improve.
ðŸ‘‰ **UX Improvement** - We can increase the user experience by updating the design. Maybe add some animations when the list switch. Right now, indicators are being used to display the user position in the app. We can maybe add some animations to it as well.
ðŸ‘‰ **Performance** - If it was a complete app, then we could have pre-loaded the images from the network and have them cached so that user doesn't have to wait for them to load. Or maybe alter the PageView to load next 4-5 items. (A bit complex)
ðŸ‘‰ **Auto Swipe** - Maybe we can add an auto swipe feature in future as well. Where every 6-7 seconds the user is taken to the next banner/slide and we update list of venues as well.
ðŸ‘‰ **Image Zoom Animation** - If we have multiple images, we can show them one after the other. Meanwhile, we can put an animation of zoom in, where a very very little zoom in is taking place, which improves the user experience and gives a premium look to the app. **Idea taken by Google News App**
